<h1>XIA JUNSU ROCKS MUSICAL: ELISABETH</h1>

<p>Kim Junsu, a member of group JYJ, is chosen as a main character of the Broadway musical Dracula, laying sound foundation as a musical actor.

His success in musicals like Mozart, Tears of Heaven, Elizabeth, and December, has raised him to the rank of a musical actor whom the audience can go see on faith, and now, he is considered as a irreplaceable actor in the musical field.

No one can confine Kim Junsu any more to just a musical actor with the origin of an idol star. In the musical community, Kim Junsu himself is very meaningful in light of breaking this prejudice. Still now, not only the general public but also people in the musical community usually look on an actor with idol origin with a jaundiced eye. Yet, Kim Junsu is the textbook example of an actor who has already overcome all this.

It is because of his irreplaceable ability. His overwhelming power on the stage, his powerful energy as a musical actor, and his ticket power make him be cast in significant musical works one after another.
